There are a total of n courses you have to take labelled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example, if prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] this means you must take the course bi before the course ai.

Given the total number of courses numCourses and a list of the prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
Example 3:

Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
ai != bi
All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct.

This Question is just an extension of previous question.
So first check 08_Course_Schedule.cpp, I have explain all working of the code.

Here I am Explaining the changes required.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Solution 1: Topological Sorting.
It is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv(u -> v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG. 

How do we do ?

1. First Find it is DAG or not. How ?
   we have done this part in preivious question.

2. Now apply Topological Sorting. (DFS + Stack)
   Apply DFS in graph, then store the processed nodes in stack. The Node having more outgoing edges will processed first.
   So after DFS, pop out the element of stack and store in a vector and return that vector.

Solution 2: Kahn's Algorithm

How do we do ?
1. Count all prerequisities for every course i.e, indegree
2. Store all coursees in bfs vector which doesnt require any prerequisities. We will do these courses first.
3. Now starting bfs in all remaining courses as long as all prerequisities of a course are completed take that course as well.

Time complexity - O(E + V)
