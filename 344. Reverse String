Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

SOLUTION:

class Solution {
public:
    void rev(vector<char>& s, int left, int right)
    {
        if(left>=right)                             // Base Condition
            return;
        swap(s[left++],s[right--]);                 // makes the problem smaller of same type            
        rev(s,left,right);
    }
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        rev(s,0,s.size()-1);
    }
};
