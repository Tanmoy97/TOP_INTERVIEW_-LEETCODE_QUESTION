There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

 

Example 1:

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
Example 2:

Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
 

Constraints:

gas.length == n
cost.length == n
1 <= n <= 10^4
0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4

SOLUTION:

The idea of the approach is to push all indices where gas[i] - cost[i] >= 0 coz these can be potential starting points for the trip.

Then we just need to check whether we can reach full circle by checking if at any point our fuel < 0 or not if it does then we can't start from that point.
Code
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        
        int n = gas.size();
        queue<int> pq; // store indices of possible answers
        
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            int temp = gas[i] - cost[i];
            if(temp >= 0) pq.push(i); // can be a possible start point
        }
        
        while(!pq.empty()){
            
            int curr = pq.front();
            pq.pop();
            bool flag = false;
            int i = curr;
            int counter = 0; // checking if cycle complete
            int fuel = 0;
            while(1){
                if(counter == n){ // if reached full circle
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
                fuel += gas[i] - cost[i];
                if(fuel < 0) break; // can't go further
                i = (i+1)%n;
                counter++;
            }
            if(flag) return curr; // only 1 answer exists
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
