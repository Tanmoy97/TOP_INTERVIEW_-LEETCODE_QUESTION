According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

 

Example 1:


Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
Example 2:


Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
 

Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 25
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.
 

Follow up:

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

SOLUTION:

class Solution {
public:
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        vector<vector<int>> v = board;

		for(int i=0;i<board.size();i++){
			for(int j=0;j<board[i].size();j++){

				//c1 will keep track of the no of 1's in
				// all the eight neighbour
				int c1 = 0;

				//upper left
				if((i-1)>=0 && (j-1)>=0){
					if(board[i-1][j-1] ==1)
						c1++;
				}

				//upper
				if((i-1)>=0 && j>=0){
					if(board[i-1][j] == 1)
						c1++;
				}

				//upper right 
				if((i-1)>=0 && (j+1)<board[i].size()){
					if(board[i-1][j+1] == 1)
						c1++;
				}

				//left 
				if((i>=0) && (j-1)>=0){
					if(board[i][j-1] == 1)
						c1++;
				}

				//right
				if(i>=0 && (j+1)<board[i].size()){
					if(board[i][j+1] == 1)
						c1++;
				}

				//lower left
				if((i+1)<board.size() && (j-1)>=0){
					if(board[i+1][j-1] == 1)
						c1++;
				}

				//down
				if((i+1)<board.size() && j>=0){
					if(board[i+1][j] == 1)
						c1++;
				}

				//lower right 
				if((i+1)<board.size() && (j+1)<board[i].size()){
					if(board[i+1][j+1] == 1)
						c1++;
				}

				//now check the value of the current cell
				int val = board[i][j];

				if(val == 0){
					//check do we have 3 c1, to make this cell alive
					if(c1 == 3)
						v[i][j] = 1;
					else
						v[i][j] = 0;

				}else{
					//check the value of c1
					if((c1<2) || (c1>3))
						v[i][j] = 0;
					else
						v[i][j] = 1;

				}     
			}
		}

		board = v;

    }
};
